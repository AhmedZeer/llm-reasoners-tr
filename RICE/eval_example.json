        "0": "Let's approach this step by step:\n\n1) Let the height of the tower be h and the distance of the car from the base of the tower at the start be d.\n\n2) When the angle of elevation is 45\u00b0, we have: tan(45\u00b0) = h\/d, or h = d.\n\n3) After 10 minutes, the angle of elevation is 60\u00b0. Let the distance traveled by the car in these 10 minutes be x. Then:\n   \n   tan(60\u00b0) = h\/(d-x)\n   \n   \u221a3 = d\/(d-x)\n   \n   \u221a3(d-x) = d\n   \n   \u221a3d - \u221a3x = d\n   \n   (\u221a3 - 1)d = \u221a3x\n   \n   d = (\u221a3\/(\u221a3-1))x\n   \n   d = (\u221a3\/(\u221a3-1))x = ((\u221a3+1)\/\u221a3)x = (1 + 1\/\u221a3)x\n\n4) Now, the car is at a distance of d - x = (1 + 1\/\u221a3)x - x = x\/\u221a3 from the base of the tower.\n\n5) If the speed of the car is v, then the time taken to cover this remaining distance would be:\n   \n   t = (x\/\u221a3)\/v = x\/(v\u221a3)\n\n6) We know that the car covered a distance of x in 10 minutes, so its speed v is x\/10.\n\n7) Substituting this in the time equation:\n   \n   t = x\/(x\/10 * \u221a3) = 10\/\u221a3 = 5.77 minutes\n\nSo the answer is, the car will reach the base of the tower in approximately 5.77 more minutes.",
        "1": "Let's solve this step by step:\n1. Let the original price of the item be x.\n2. The discounted price is 78% of the original price (100% - 22% = 78%), which is 0.78x.\n3. The customer uses a $20 coupon, so the final price paid is 0.78x - 20.\n4. We are told that the customer paid $1.90 more than half the original price. So, 0.78x - 20 = 0.5x + 1.90.\n5. Solving the equation:\n   0.78x - 20 = 0.5x + 1.90\n   0.78x - 0.5x = 1.90 + 20\n   0.28x = 21.90\n   x = 21.90 \/ 0.28\n   x = 78.21428...\n6. Since the options don't include cents, we round down to the nearest dollar, which is $78.\n\nSo the answer is E) $78.",
        "2": "To be divisible by both 9 and 12, a number must be divisible by their least common multiple (LCM).\n\nThe LCM of 9 and 12 is 36 because:\n9 = 3 \u00d7 3\n12 = 3 \u00d7 4\nLCM(9, 12) = 3 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 4 = 36\n\nAmong the given options, only 36 is divisible by both 9 and 12.\n\nSo the answer is A) 36.",
        "3": "Let's approach this step by step:\n\n1) The probability that Stock A will not increase in value is 1 - 0.56 = 0.44.\n\n2) The probability that Stock B will not increase in value is 1 - 0.74 = 0.26.\n\n3) For neither of these events to occur, both Stock A and Stock B must not increase in value.\n\n4) If we assume that these events are independent, then the probability of both events occurring is the product of their individual probabilities.\n\n5) So, the probability that neither stock will increase in value is 0.44 * 0.26 = 0.1144.\n\n6) However, the question asks for the greatest possible value for this probability. The greatest value would occur if the events were perfectly dependent, i.e., if Stock A fails to increase, then Stock B is certain to fail to increase as well.\n\n7) In this case, the probability would be the minimum of the two individual probabilities, which is 0.26.\n\nSo the answer is B) 0.26.",
        "4": "Let the cost price be x. The selling price is 120% of the cost price, which is 1.2x. We know the selling price is Rs. 360.\n\nSo, 1.2x = 360\nx = 360\/1.2 = 300\n\nSo the answer is B) Rs. 300.",
        "5": "Let's solve this step by step:\n\n1) The second time, 1 out of 20 marbles pulled out was black. This means 5% of the marbles in the bag are black.\n\n2) We know that 20 marbles were painted black and put back in the bag. These 20 black marbles represent 5% of the total marbles in the bag.\n\n3) If 20 is 5%, then 100% would be 20 * 20 = 400.\n\nSo the answer is D) 400 marbles.",
        "6": "There are 26 letters in the alphabet, so there are 26 choices for the first letter and 26 choices for the second letter. This gives 26 * 26 = 676 possible letter combinations.\n\nFor the numbers, there are 10 choices for the first digit (0-9) and 10 choices for the second digit. This gives 10 * 10 = 100 possible number combinations.\n\nSince the letter and number choices are independent, we multiply the number of letter combinations by the number of number combinations:\n\n676 * 100 = 67,600\n\nSo the answer is D) 65000, which is the closest to the actual total of 67,600 distinct bike numbers.",
        "7": "Let's solve this step by step:\n\n1. The total distance covered by the train is 100 miles\/hour * 10 hours = 1000 miles.\n\n2. The train covers 1\/4 of the distance at 100 miles\/hour. So, the time taken to cover this distance is:\n   (1\/4 * 1000 miles) \/ (100 miles\/hour) = 2.5 hours\n\n3. The remaining 3\/4 of the distance is covered at 75 miles\/hour. The distance remaining is:\n   3\/4 * 1000 miles = 750 miles\n\n4. The time taken to cover the remaining distance at 75 miles\/hour is:\n   (750 miles) \/ (75 miles\/hour) = 10 hours\n\n5. The total journey duration is the sum of the time taken in both parts:\n   2.5 hours + 10 hours = 12.5 hours\n\nSo the answer is C) 12.5 hours.",
        "8": "Let's solve this step by step:\n\n1) Let the number of students who attended the prom night be x and the number of students who took part in the debating session be y.\n\n2) We know that x \u2265 45% of 200 = 90 and y \u2265 35% of 200 = 70.\n\n3) The maximum number of students who could have neither attended the prom night nor the debating session would be when x and y are at their minimum values, i.e., x = 90 and y = 70.\n\n4) In the worst case scenario, all 70 students who took part in the debating session also attended the prom night. This means that the total number of students who attended either the prom night or the debating session or both is equal to the number who attended the prom night, which is 90.\n\n5) Therefore, the number of students who neither attended the prom night nor the debating session is 200 - 90 = 110.\n\nSo the answer is E) 110.",
        "9": "Let's solve this step by step:\n\n1) The salesperson gets a 10% commission on each sale. This means for each sale of $250, he earns $25 (10% of $250).\n\n2) To find the number of sales needed to reach a salary of at least $1000, we divide $1000 by the commission per sale:\n\n   $1000 \u00f7 $25 per sale = 40 sales\n\n3) Therefore, the salesperson needs to make at least 40 sales of $250 each to reach a salary of $1000.\n\nSo the answer is D) 40.",
        "10": "Let's break this down step-by-step:\n\n1) The company produces 420 units per month. So in a year, they produce 420 * 12 = 5040 units.\n\n2) The production cost per unit is $110. So the total production cost for a year is 5040 * 110 = $554,400.\n\n3) The company wants to make a yearly profit of at least $626,400. This means the total revenue from sales must be at least $554,400 + $626,400 = $1,180,800.\n\n4) To find the minimum selling price per unit, we divide the total revenue by the number of units sold:\n\n   Minimum selling price = $1,180,800 \/ 5040 = $234.29\n\n5) The question asks for the minimum selling price that guarantees this profit, so we need to round up to the nearest option. The nearest option above $234.29 is $240.\n\nSo the answer is C) $240."
